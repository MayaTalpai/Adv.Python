        "      The Colorful Game of Life has the same rules as Conway's Game of Life, except that all living cells also have a color assigned to them. When a new cell is born, it will take on the average color of its parents. Color variation can be added so that newly born cells can deviate slightly in color. Living cells will keep their color fixed until they die.\n",

        "      colored_grid (2D list of Hue objects): The grid that should be stepped through\n",
        "      color_variation (float): A newly born cell will deviate from its color randomly up or down, with this amount being the maximum possible deviation.\n",
        "      hard_boundary (bool): Setting this to False will identify opposite edges so that cells touching the boundary will communicate with cells on the other side of the grid.\n",
        "      rule (2D list of integers): The first set of elements is how many neighbors leads to a birth, and the second is how many neighbors lead to a cell surviving.\n",
